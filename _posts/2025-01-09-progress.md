# Completing the pipeline

I have completed the CICD pipeline, however I do have additional clean up I will need to perform. Thus far I have my local git clone, github with actions, aws s3 with corrected ACL and JSON for PUT. This took a great deal of time since this is the first time I have built such a pipeline. I am hopeful I will have enough time to complete an impressive configuration. Currently I am awaiting my DNS record to become available on the NS. I have registered the TLD maw.lol for use on this project and am in the midst of utilizing Fastly's TLS features to create a certificate for this hostname. 

'''bash
watch -n 10 -d=permanent "dig +noall +answer _acme-challenge.fastly.maw.lol"
'''

Next steps will include updating the hostname on this jekyll instance to ensure the hostname will be fastly.maw.lol for use with Fastly. 

I would like to include a large number of images to test the available image optimization feature.
